# Michael Clayton's Dot Files
# Tailored specifically for Linux/Unix Machines
# Enjoy!
# 
# Dot files are hidden files so in order to make things easier, I 
# made them .txt files for ease of transferring.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Be sure to backup and remove your current dot files if you have them:
# (.bashrc, .vimrc, .profile, .bash_profile)
# Place .txt files into home directory (cd ~/)
# Rename each FILE_NAME.txt file into .FILE_NAME
# Example: vimrc.txt should become .vimrc
