## Michael Clayton's Dot Files
Tailored specifically for Macs
Enjoy!

Dot files are hidden files so in order to make things easier, I
made them `.sh` files for ease of transferring.

### INSTRUCTIONS:

#### Recommended:
View the automatic installation instructions [Here](https://github.com/mcclayton/DotFiles#mac-installation).

#### Manual

Be sure to backup and remove your current dot files if you have them:
(.bashrc, .vimrc, .profile, .bash_profile)

Place `.sh` files into home directory (cd ~/)

Rename each FILE_NAME.sh file into .FILE_NAME
Example: vimrc.sh should become .vimrc
