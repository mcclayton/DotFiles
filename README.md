Configuration files are tailored for Macintosh or Unix/Linux Machines.

## Mac installation

For convenience, this installation script will set up a Mac with an opinionated fully configured development environment.
It will configure and install dot files, applications, packages, et cetera.

However, the script is designed to be interactive so users can still pick and choose what they want
to install/configure.

```
./install.sh
```

This is script is designed to be safe and can be run multiple times.
