#### Important: these configuration files are intended for Terminal Emulators with 256 color support. ####

My configuration files: (.bashrc, .profile, .vimrc)

These configuration files are simple (no extra fluff), useful, and commented for your convenience.  

Configuration files are tailored for Macintosh or Unix/Linux Machines.

Feel free to pick and choose what features you want.

Enjoy!

## Mac installation

To setup, configure, and install a curated list of applications for a developer environment: run the script
```
./install.sh
```

This will bring up an interactive installation process that will backup dot files, set the ones from this repo, install packages and applications, etc.
