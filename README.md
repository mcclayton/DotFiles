#### Important: these configuration files are intended for Terminal Emulators with 256 color support. ####

My configuration files: (.bashrc, .profile, .vimrc)

These configuration files are simple (no extra fluff), useful, and commented for your convenience.  

Configuration files are tailored for Macintosh or Unix/Linux Machines.

Feel free to pick and choose what features you want.

Enjoy!

Note: Since the vim/bundles are git submodules, you will need to manually clone those into those folders.
I will be creating an installation script or installation steps to make this easier in the future.
