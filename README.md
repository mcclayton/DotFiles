### Important: these configuration files are intended for Terminal Emulators with 256 color support. ###

My configuration files: (.bashrc, .profile, .vimrc)

These configuration files are simple (no extra fluff), useful, and commented for your convenience.  

Configuration files are tailored for Macintosh or Unix/Linux Machines.

Feel free to pick and choose what features you want.

Enjoy!
