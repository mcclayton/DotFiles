**ðŸš€ Complete Automated Mac Development Environment Setup ðŸš€**

## About
This repository contains the [install script](https://github.com/mcclayton/DotFiles/blob/master/install.sh) which, when run, will completely
set up a Macintosh machine configured to [Michael Clayton](https://github.com/mcclayton)'s preferred and opinionated development environment.
It will configure and install dot files, applications, packages, et cetera.

The script is designed to be interactive so users can still pick and choose what they want
to install/configure, however, you may still want to look through individual Dot Files and
pick/choose what you want at a more granular level.

This script is designed to be safe and can be run multiple times.

## Usage
Simply run the [install script](https://github.com/mcclayton/DotFiles/blob/master/install.sh) with:
```bash
./install.sh
```
